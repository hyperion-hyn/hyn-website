  title: Hyperion
  subtitle: What is Hyperion?
  content: Hyperion, a decentralized map platform, aims to achieve the “One Map” vision - to provide an unified view of global map data and service, and to make it universally accessible just like a public utility for 10B people. Built on the Spatial Consensus Protocol which encloses not just spatial information but also value transfer, Hyperion fundamentally redefines the way we create and consume map services, conforming to our first principles to make maps aggressively open and decentralized.

titan:
  content: The first ever truly privacy-aware map application built on strong cryptographic primitives. All map functions such as positioning and searching are computed locally at the phone. Your location trace will never leave your phone and you have the power to burn them all with just one click. Through our cryptographic library, you can even share a location to your friend with no other intermedia platforms learning where you are and where you want to go.<br /><br />
    - Secure public key identity<br /><br />
    - Ultra privacy with no location trace leaving your phone<br /><br />
    - Cryptographic Location Sharing (CLS)

map3:
  content: Map3 enables new spatial data usage model and 1000x infrastructure in scale, performance and cost. Map3 is essentially a decentralized PaaS for Maps/LBS, powered by the One Map Compute technology that supports a massive network of decentralized Map3 nodes.<br /><br />
    - Create and use arbitrary map layers with custom usage policy<br /><br />
    - Scalable decentralized infrastructure to enable 1000x performance<br /><br />
    - Seamless transition from other map technology stack (e.g., Mapbox, OpenLayer)<br /><br />
    - Strong cryptographic primitive to support map data encryption

atlas:
  content:
    Hyperion has launched Atlas Mainnet. It is a high-performance spatial consensus blockchain that supports world-scale map service based on Elastic Spatial Sharding. It aims to solve spatial service requests such as map asset transactions and validation, with special features such as censorship resistance, open participation and fault-tolerance. Atlas will empower Hyperion ONE MAP to build decentralized global map economy that serves 10 billion users.<br /><br />
    Technically, Atlas will improve in scalability, low-latency, low-cost, privacy-preservation, extensibility, and interoperability. Map3 nodes will join Atlas nodes by re-staking to improve the security and performance of blockchain network. 88 validation nodes will be selected out of all Atlas nodes based on their ranking in staking amount, to obtain block production rewards.

  maps:
    version1:
      title: MAP 1.0
      subtitle: Digital Map
      content: Maps are made digital, interactive and searchable. But lacks openness, privacy and large-scale community contribution.
    version2:
      title: MAP 2.0
      subtitle: Open Map
      content: The Open Street Map initiative allowed for wide community participation, providing free and open data. However, the underlying technology have not improved much since its inception 10 years ago. Furthermore, the open contribution model lacks social-economic structure, making difficult to govern and incentivize the community.
    version3:
      title: MAP 3.0
      subtitle: Concensus Map
      content: Coherent system design of technology, community and economy. Enabled by decentralized map technology, self-governed community and sustainable map economy.

      title1: Cryptographic location share instructions
      content1: Titan achieves 100% privacy protection by cryptographic location share. Users can share encrypted location messages, and view location in decoded map with easy steps.
      title2: A simple guide to “cryptographic location share”
      content2: <h6>User A (Share encrypted location message), User B (View decoded map)</h6>
        <h6><strong>Step 1：Share location</strong></h6>
        <h6>1.	User B copy individual public key address and share it with User A via Messaging Apps</h6>
        <h6>2.	User A select a location on Titan map, and click “share private location”</h6>
        <h6>3.	User A paste User B’s public key address</h6>
        <h6>4.	User A fill in notes to share with location (optional)</h6>
        <h6>5.	User A Click “encrypt and share” to generate location code and share to B</h6>
        <h6><strong>Step 2：View decoded map</strong></h6>
        <h6>1.	User B copy location code received from User A</h6>
        <h6>2.	Titan will automatically shows the code. User B click “Decode location in Map”</h6>
        <h6>3.	Or User B manually paste the code to the top frame</h6>
        <h6>4.	If location shows, your location is decoded successfully.</h6>
